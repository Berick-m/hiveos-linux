##In this file, you can change or add kernel boot parameters.
##Be very careful! Do not do anything unless you are absolutely
##sure of what you are doing. Incorrect parameters can lead to the inability to boot the system!

##Also keep in mind that the parameters will take effect only after the end of the selfupgrade command and the system reboot.

##One parameter per line.



## For example if you want to enable ipv6 in kernel - uncomment next line
#ipv6.disable=0

## For buggy bioses 
#pci=noaer,nocrs
