PhoenixMiner 5.5c
* Added new `-mcdag` parameter to reset the memory overclock on Nvidia cards during DAG generation. 
  This may allow you to set higher memory overclock on your Nvidia cards without risking corrupt DAG buffer, 
  which can lead to excessive number of incorrect shares. Use `-mcdag 1` (by default the value is 0, which 
  means turned off) to use this new feature. The miner will then wait for about 7 seconds before starting 
  DAG generation to allow the script enough time to reset the memory overclock.
* Option `-tt` is now strictly for controlling the fan behavior. 
  E.g. -tt 60 sets auto-fan speed with target temperature 60C; -tt -70 sets fixed fan speed 70%; and -tt 0 turns off the fan control. All these can be specified per GPU.
* There is a new `-hwm` parameter that allows controlling the frequency of the hardware monitoring, which was also done by -tt in the previous versions of PhoenixMiner
* Other small improvements and fixes
