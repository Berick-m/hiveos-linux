lolMiner v1.18a
* Improved Zombie mode power draw & speed Polaris GPUs (R9 380, RX Fury, RX 4x0 and RX 5x0). 
  Depending on configuration, the zombie mode now uses 0.5 to 1W less energy and is 0.2 to 0.4 mh/s faster
* Added --zombie-tune parameter for Polaris GPUs. This will increase the performance of zombie mode (further up on the general improvement) by an other 5-15%, 
  depending on parameter and epoch (later epochs profit more). Default value is 0 (off), for most cards the value of 2 is optimal. 
  If you see cards getting slower then before, set to 0 or 1. 
  Note: you either can give one value for the whole rig or provide a comma separated list for each card individually. Cards not running zombie mode ignore the parameter
* The parameter --4g-alloc-size can now also be set for each card individually
* Slight rework of Beam Hash III back end. Improves poolside hash rate by approx 0.2 to 0.3% - displayed hashrate and power consume kept equal
* Fixed: segmentation fault when the dns resolve of a pool fails
* Fixed: miner does not restart after connection loss
* Applied potential fix for "address or port already in use" bug
