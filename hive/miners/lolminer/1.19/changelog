lolMiner v1.19
* Added automatic tuning mode for --zombie-tune. This is default on, so just run the miner with --4g-alloc-size set only to run the zombie mode automatic tuning.
  At the end it will report the configuration in case you want to use the configuration again.
  You can also exclude cards from tuning or set their value manually, e.g. --zombie-tune 2,auto,0,auto 
  will run the automatic tuning on the 2nd and 4th GPU while using fixed number 2 for first card and 0 for the 3rd one.
  The tuning will need about 30 seconds per card in the rig to show first results. 
  The next two phases take about 1 minute per card and followed by a approximately 1.5 minutes fine tune phase.
* Ethash stratum connection will now reconnect after three pool rejected shares in a row that did pass own CPU verify before. 
  This solves issues with unstable proxy forwarding e.g. in some ZIL pools. Also helps to get quicker to a failover pool if configured.
